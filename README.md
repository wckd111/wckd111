## 🧭 About Me
I’m a **Data Analyst** who loves figuring out *why things work the way they do* — in data, systems, and decisions.  
Numbers make sense to me when they connect back to people and actions.  

I recently finished my **Master’s in Business Analytics** at the University of Dayton (GPA 3.6), where my work focused on:
- Automating analytics workflows that reduced reporting time by 40%
- Designing dashboards that improved library resource allocation by 25%
- Applying machine learning to real-world healthcare datasets (AUC 0.89 on SEER survival prediction)

I believe the real challenge isn’t finding insights — it’s making them *visible and useful*.

## 🧩 What I Work With
- **Data:** Python, R, SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redshift, Oracle)  
- **Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau, Excel  
- **Modeling:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost  
- **Cloud & Tools:** AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), Azure, GCP, Git  
- **Practices:** Data Governance, Feature Engineering, ETL, A/B Testing

## 🧠 Projects That Kept Me Up at Night
### 🧬 Cancer Survival Prediction
Built a complete ML pipeline on SEER data (~800K records, 149 features)  
Used NLP to process physician notes and improve survival predictions.  
Best model: **CatBoost (AUC 0.89)**  
👉 [View on GitHub](https://github.com/wckd111/ColorectalCancerSurvivalPrediction-Shantanu)

### 🧠 Depression Detection Using AI  
Explored facial, voice, and text signals to detect early symptoms.  
Integrated OpenCV, MFCCs, and NLP sentiment analysis.  
SVM reached **85% accuracy** — proof that emotion and data can coexist.

### 📚 Library Data Analytics (Work Experience)  
Built Power BI dashboards on top of 100K+ records in Sierra ILS.  
Turned routine circulation data into real-time insights that saved staff hours every week.

## 🛠 What Drives Me
I enjoy bridging the gap between data engineering and business impact.  
My comfort zone is where messy data meets complex questions.  
If something can be automated or visualized — I’ll find a way.
